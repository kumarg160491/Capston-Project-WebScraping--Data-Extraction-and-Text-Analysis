# Capston-Project-WebScraping--Data-Extraction-and-Text-Analysis

Objective
This assignment is to extract some sections (which are mentioned below) from SEC / EDGAR financial reports and perform text analysis to compute variables those are explained below. Link to SEC / EDGAR financial reports are given in excel spreadsheet “cik_list.xlsx”. 
Please add https://www.sec.gov/Archives/ to every cells of column F (cik_list.xlsx) to access link to the financial report. 
Example: Row 2, column F contains edgar/data/3662/0000950170-98-000413.txt

Add https://www.sec.gov/Archives/ to form financial report link i.e. 

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/3662/0000950170-98-000413.txt 

Variables:
“Text Analysis.docx” you need to compute following: 

Section 1: Positive score, negative score, polarity score
Section 2: Average Sentence Length, percentage of complex words, fog index
Section 4: Complex word count
Section 5: Word count
 
In addition to these eight variables, compute two more items: “uncertainty” and “constraining”. These variables are calculated similar to the ones in Section 1.1 or Section 4. Attached the lists of words that are classified as uncertain or constraining.

For uncertainty: “uncertainty_dictionary.xlsx”
For constraining: “constraining_dictionary.xlsx”
 
That means you need to collect/compute minimum 10 variables in total.
